  <h2>DEFORSETATION</h2>
  <p><a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/deforestation" target="_blank" title = "education.nationalgeographic.org">Deforestation</a> is the purposeful clearing of forested land. Throughout history and into modern times, forests have been razed to make space for agriculture and animal grazing, and to obtain wood for fuel, manufacturing, and construction.</p>

  <p>Deforestation has greatly altered landscapes around the world. About 2,000 years ago, 80 percent of Western Europe was forested; today the figure is 34 percent. In North America, about half of the forests in the eastern part of the continent were cut down from the 1600s to the 1870s for timber and agriculture. China has lost great expanses of its forests over the past 4,000 years and now just over 20 percent of it is forested. Much of Earthâ€™s farmland was once forests.</p>
